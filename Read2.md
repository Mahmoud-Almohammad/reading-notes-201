# HTML text fundamentals

## Headings and paragraphs

When we write our text, it must be is a headings and paragrapgs because it meke it more suitble and more designed.

WE have a six levels of heading tags in html, \<h1\>, \<h2\>, \<h3\>, \<h4\>, \<h5\> and \<h6\>, and each one of them has a different use for text, so for example \<h1\> has a bold and big font size so it's apropreate for **top level heading** and then \<h2\> has a bit smaller font size and bold so it's apropreate for sub-heading texts and so on.

## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Semantics are very important things in our lives, because every thing we look at it we know exactly whet it do, so for example when we see a man in the middle of the street and in his hand a traffic sign we know that this man is traffic policeman.

The same function here in html, we see (for example) \<h1\> tag so we know that the function of using this tag is a top level heading, instead, we can use a \<span\> tag to make text loke like a top level heading tike th example below:

    <span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0; display: block;">Is this a top level heading?</span>.

# Advanced text formatting

AS we get introduced to fundametal text formatting in html, there are much more tags for formatting text, but these tags don't seem to be so much important like the fumdanetal one's, so here in the table below we are going to introduce some of these tags:

| Nmae of the tag                          | The tag                           |  The finction                                         |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Description lists <br> Description Term <br> Description Definition| \<dl\>\</dl\> <br> \<dt\>\</dt\> <br> \<dd\>\</dd\>                     | The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.|
| Blockquotes | \<blockquotes\>\</blockquotes\> |If a section of block level content is quoted from somewhere else |
| Inline Blockquotes | \<q\>\</q\> | The same function of the **Blockquote** tag  |
